**Issuing Authority - Usage**

Used to define responsibilities.
Can also be used to establish geographical responsibility, e.g. Cert only for national security researchers and/or vendors.
It is mostly used for sectoral or geographic specialization.

*Example:*

* ICS Cert states that "[they] coordinate any ICS related vulnerabilities".
  This means that ICS is not responsible for IT products (e.g. Microsoft Exchange).

Especially relevant for large companies/organizations or managed service providers.
Also relevant if there are several teams that issue advisories within the same group.

*Example:*

* Despite the "same" name of "Siemens" and "Siemens Energy", responsibilities can be described more clearly.

The value should be a full text description.

*Example:*

* "Example PSIRT is responsible for any vulnerabilities related to Example products."
