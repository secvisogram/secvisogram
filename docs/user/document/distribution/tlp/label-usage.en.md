**Label - Usage**

The label should be set and be valid. There are four color (or traffic light) values:

* `RED` - *personal for named recipients only*:

  In the context of a meeting, for example, RED information is limited to those present at the meeting.
  The distribution of RED information will generally be via a defined list and in extreme circumstances may only be passed verbally or in person.

* `AMBER` - *limited distribution*:

  The recipient may share AMBER information with others within their organization, but only on a ‘need-to-know’ basis.
  The originator may be expected to specify the intended limits of that sharing.

* `GREEN` - *community wide*:

  Information in this category can be circulated widely within a particular community.
  However, the information may not be published or posted publicly on the Internet, nor released outside the community.

* `WHITE` - *unlimited*:

  Subject to standard copyright rules, WHITE information may be distributed freely, without restriction.
