**Id - Usage**

The unique name of the document within the publishing entity.

In combination with the publisher namespace (`document/publisher/namespace`) the CSAF document is globally identifiable.
An additional version allows a version unique identification.

The tracking ID remains constant when a new version of the document is released.

The filename of the document is derived from this ID (see section 5.1 of the specification).

The ID is typically a combination of a short identifier of the publishing entity, year and a sequential number.

*Examples:*

* `ECSA-2022-00123` (Example Company Security Advisory)
