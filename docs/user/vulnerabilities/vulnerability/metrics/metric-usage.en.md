# Metric - Usage

For CVSS metrics, the referenced schema must be adhered to.

For CVSS metrics, the computed values must be correct according to their definition. For this computation, the `vectorString` takes precedence over the other properties.

For CVSS metrics, the given properties must not contradict the CVSS vector.

CVSS v2 (`cvss_v2`) should not be the only metric item used.
Instead of using CVSS v3.0, an upgrade to CVSS v3.1 should be considered.
Generally, it is recommended to use CVSS v3.1 or CVSS v4.0.
