**Known Affected - Usage**

Listing affected products facilitates the examination if products are affected.

A product listed here must not be listed in any of the following

* `product_status/known_not_affected[]`
* `product_status/first_fixed[]`
* `product_status/fixed[]`
* `product_status/under_investigation[]`

For each product ID listed here, a remediation should exist.

For each product ID listed here, a score object which covers the product should exist.

For all profiles other than `csaf_vex`, an action statement should be listed in the remediations - also for products for which there is no (planned) fix.

For each entry a corresponding `full_product_name` element with matching `product_id` must be defined.
