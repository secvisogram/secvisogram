**Sbom Url - Usage**

If a SBOM is offered for download (public or protected), the URL can serve as a unique identifier for a version of the product.
If it links to a protected area, the URL must still point to the canonical download value (not just to the portal where it is retrieved), otherwise uniqueness is lost.

A SBOM URL should not be used in combination with a product version range.
